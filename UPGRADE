Upgrade Notes
==============

From Hypermail 2.3.0 to Hypermail 2.3.1
-----------------------------------------
The configuration directive "htmlmessage_deleted" has been
renamed "htmlmessage_deleted_spam".

The "deleted" configuration directive has been deprecated
in favor of "annotated". However, for backwards compatibility
with legacy archives, it will continue to be honored.

From Hypermail 1.x to Hypermail 2.x 
-----------------------------------
!!!!WARNING!!!!

Hypermail 2.x HTML output files, indexes, etc are not compatible with 1.x 
files.  When installing 2.x, all existing HTML files in the specified output 
directory must be removed first.  

Use the original 1.x mailbox files to regenerate the new 2.x archive. 
If the mailboxes are not available it should be possible to use the 
script hypetombox.pl in the contrib/ directory.
